      "content1": "When you’re running a business in the packaging industry, you would have decided to purchase a Form Fill Seal (FFS) machine. While this machine enables the workers to pack more products in fewer shifts, it can reduce the costs considerably. But, when you have a clear idea about what you need to purchase, here’s what you can consider before making a purchase. ",
      "qa" : [
        {
          "q": "Choose as per the requirements",
          "a": "While every machine has different features, you must choose an FFS machine based on the needs. Vertical FFS machines are capable of filling and sealing liquid and solid products along the automated assembly line. You are sure to expect faster production at a lower operational cost. On the other hand, you can perceive maximum performance when bags need to be formed using a tube of film through a Tubular FFS machine. "
        },
        {
          "q": "Select a machine which is safe to use",
          "a": "As your team members set up the infrastructure, you must always check how safe it is to use the machine. Think about purchasing a machine which is not too small or too big. In addition, you must also have ample space while using the machine and maintaining it in future. The layout of the machine also matters most. For instance, you need more space when the inline machines are running linearly. However, as the rotary machines operate in a certain manner, they require less space. "
        },
        {
          "q": "Look for specific features",
          "a": "In the current era, many FFS machines boast numerous performance features. But, when you have made up your mind to buy a machine, you must be clear about the features that serve to be beneficial. Firstly, you must observe the machine frame construction that can have a considerable impact on the overall performance and its life span. Above all, welded frames are suitable for packaging food items as they don't have any bolts. This prevents the entry of bacteria and spillage of the product. "
